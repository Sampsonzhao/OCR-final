abstract: "Through the past 40 years, we have seen a huge decrease in the Birth rates in the US, which was exasperated further within the past 10 years. We have seen birth rates at 65-70 per 1000 people in 1980s to less then 50 per 1000 people in 2020. These birth rates have looked at multiple different factors as reasons, such as the cost of living being too high for some families to bare, to effectively the lack of wanting a child. These factors play a large role in the continued development of the future population which has lead to large concerns towards the further continuation of this decreasing trend of birth rates and effectively the downstream effects of this continuing. This paper is a reproduction of the original paper 'The Puzzle of Falling US Birth Rates since the Great Recession'."
