14. THE SONG OF THE SEA WIND
How it sings, sings, sings,
Blowing sharply from the sea-line,
With an edge of salt that stings;
How it laughs aloud, and passes,
As it cuts the close cliff-grasses:
How it sings again, and whistles
As it shakes the stout sea-thistles— ,
How it sings! a
How it shrieks, shrieks, shrieks, -
In the crannies of the headland,
In the gashes of the creeks; ae
How it shrieks once more, and catches
Up the yeliow foam in patches; — <4
How it hurls it out and over Se
To the corn-field’and the clover— == | 7s
How it roars, roars, roars, i an
In the iron under-caverms,; «ee
In the hollows of the shores; <a
How it roars anew, and thunders, =
As the strong hull splits and sunders:
And the spent ship, tempest-driven, =
On the reef lies rent and tives
