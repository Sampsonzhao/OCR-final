14. THE SONG OF THE SEA WIND
How it sings, sings, sings,
Blowing sharply from the sea-line,
With an edge of salt that stings;
How it laughs aloud, and passes,
As it cuts the close cliff-grasses:
How it sings again, and whistles
As it shakes the stout sea-thistles—
How it sings!
How it shrieks, shrieks, shrieks,
In the crannies of the headland,
In the gashes of the creeks;
How it shrieks once more, and catches
Up the yellow foam in patches; a
How it hurls it out and over | 3
To the corn-field and the clover— =
How it roars, roars, roars, er
In the iron under-caverns, ee
In the hollows of the shores;
How it roars anew, and thunders, a.
As the strong hull splits and sunders:
eee ee
And the spent ship, tempest-driven, =
On the reef lies rent and ri VON
How it roars! a
ee Cll
How it wails, wails, wails, ==
In the tangle of t! he wreckage,
