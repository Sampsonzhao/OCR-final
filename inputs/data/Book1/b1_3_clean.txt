structures is not yet fully understood, and it is not possible to
relate individual symptoms to involvement at specific sites.

M@ PARKINSONISM
Parkinsonism is characterized by a combination of rigidity, brady-
kinesia, tremor, and postural instability that can occur for a variety
of reasons but is usually idiopathic (Parkinson's disease or paralysis
agitans). Bradykinesia should be present before a diagnosis of Par-
kinson’s disease is made. Focal dystonic features may be present.
Cognitive decline occurs in many patients as the disease advances.
Other nonmotor symptoms include affective disorders (anxiety
or depression); confusion, cognitive impairment, or personality
changes; apathy; fatigue; abnormalities of autonomic function (eg,
sphincter or sexual dysfunction, dysphagia and choking, sweating
abnormalities, sialorrhea, or disturbances of blood pressure regula-
tion); sleep disorders; and sensory complaints or pain. The disease
is incurable, is generally progressive, and leads to increasing dis-
ability with time, but pharmacologic treatment may relieve motor
symptoms and improve the quality of life for many years.
Pathogenesis
The pathogenesis of parkinsonism seems to relate to a combina-
tion of impaired degradation of proteins, intracellular protein
accumulation and aggregation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial
damage, inflammatory cascades, and apoptosis. Studies in twins
_ suggest that genetic factors are important, especially when the
