Drugs Used in the Treatment of Gastrointestinal Diseases 1099

channel (ClC-2) in the small intestine. This increases chloriderich fluid secretion into the intestine, which stimulates intestinal 
motility and shortens intestinal transit time. Over 50% of patients 
experience a bowel movement within 24 hours of taking one dose. 
A dose of 24 mcg orally twice daily is the recommended dose for 
treatment of chronic constipation. There appears to be no loss of 
efficacy with long-term therapy. After discontinuation of the drug, 
constipation may return to its pretreatment severity. Lubiprostone 
has minimal systemic absorption but is designated category C for 
pregnancy because of increased fetal loss in guinea pigs. Lubipro-
stone may cause nausea in up to 30% of patients due to delayed 
gastric emptying.
Linaclotide and plecanatide are minimally absorbed, short 
amino acid peptides that stimulate intestinal chloride secre-
tion through a different mechanism by binding to and acti-
vating guanylate cyclase-C on the luminal surface. This leads 
to increased intracellular and extracellular cyclic guanosine 
monophosphate (cGMP) with activation of the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), followed by 
chloride-rich secretion and acceleration of intestinal transit. 
Both agents are approved for the treatment of chronic constipa-
tion (linaclotide 145 mcg orally once daily; plecanatide 3 mg 
orally once daily); linaclotide is also approved for the treatment 
of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (290 mcg orally 
once daily). These agents result in an average increase of 1–2 
bowel movements per week that usually occurs within the first 
week of treatment. Upon discontinuation of the drug, bowel 
movement frequency returns to normal within 1 week. The 
most common side effect is diarrhea, which occurs in up to 
20% of patients, with severe diarrhea in 2%. These drugs have 
negligible absorption at standard doses. Both drugs are contra-
indicated in pediatric patients because of reports of increased 
mortality in juvenile mice from dehydration. (Crofelemer is a 
small molecule with the opposite effect: it is an inhibitor of the 
CFTR channel and has recently been approved for the treatment 
of HIV-drug-induced diarrhea.)

OPIOID RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS
Acute and chronic therapy with opioids may cause constipation 
by decreasing intestinal motility, which results in prolonged tran-
sit time and increased absorption of fecal water (see Chapter 31). 
Use of opioids after surgery for treatment of pain as well as endog-
enous opioids also may prolong the duration of postoperative 
ileus. These effects are mainly mediated through intestinal mu 
(μ)-opioid receptors. Two selective antagonists of the μ-opioid 
receptor are commercially available: methylnaltrexone bromide 
and alvimopan. Because these agents do not readily cross the 
blood-brain barrier, they inhibit peripheral μ-opioid receptors 
without impacting analgesic effects within the central nervous 
system. Methylnaltrexone is approved for the treatment of 
opioid-induced constipation in patients receiving palliative care 
for advanced illness who have had inadequate response to other 
agents. It is administered as a subcutaneous injection (0.15 mg/
kg) every 2 days. Alvimopan is approved for short-term use to
